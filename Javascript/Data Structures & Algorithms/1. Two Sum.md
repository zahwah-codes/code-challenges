Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


### Thinking

- There are two ways to solve this. It's either to use a brute force method (with a runtime complexity of O(n^2)) or use a data structure (with a runtime complexity of O(n)). For this problem, I decided to choose a hash table. A hash table is a data structure that maps key to values. This is the perfect solution as we want to map our number to our index.
- First, I created a hashmap variable. Then I looped through the nums length. I created a variable called num to store the values in the nums array and a potentialKey variable. By substracting the target value from the current index value num, we're able to check if the remainder already exists. If it doesn't, then we juust add the value we just tried to the map and move on.

### Solution

```js

var twoSum = function (nums, target) {

  const hashTable = new Map();

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const num = nums[i]
    const potentialKey = target - num

    if (hashTable.has(potentialKey)) { // 'has' for checking if it has the key
      return [i, hashTable.get(potentialKey)] // for getting the value based on the key
    } else {
      hashTable.set(num, i); // for setting the key and value pair
    }
  }
}

```
