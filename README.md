# Code Challenges

## Why did I make this repo? 🤨

I created this repo to save all my progress with code challenges. I'm documenting my answers and thought process when answering the challenges. I also hope it will be helpful for anyone looking for answers to challenges they're struggling to answer!

## Which code challenges do I do?

- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)

## Updates

I will keep updating this repo weekly with my daily code challenges. My current goal is to work on 3 Codewars and 1 Leetcode a day 👩🏻‍💻
